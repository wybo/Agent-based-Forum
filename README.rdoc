  "Weighting up critical mass"

Agent-based model of users on a forum, or other thread-based platform.

Its aim is examining the impact of structural factors on thread-based 
platforms ability to attain critical mass.

Examples of such factors are how threads are layed out, in which order
they are shown (if any), and whether new users get to see new threads
first...

Still under heavy development. Ideas, comments and feedback welcome
(mail@wybowiersma.net).
